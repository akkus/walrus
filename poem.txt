Poem on Git

When I am in class, git comes to me knowing doors
When I am out of the class, not sure what will happen.

So my Source Trees, may be Git is the way to go

Many Came....Many Survivied.....Many more to Come
Not sure which way to go...

Organization changes, People changes....
Software changes, Source control changes...
Devices Changes...
